# Low Resolution Interface Experiment

An Angular experiment exploring a low-resolution interface with keyboard-only navigation. Inspired by Elektron devices
and minimalist design.

# Description

This project is a work in progress and is intended to be a simple proof-of-concept, rather than a complete solution. It
explores a minimalist interface design with a aesthetic inspired by Elektron devices.

The project uses a low-resolution interface and keyboard-only navigation to create a unique user experience. It will be
expanded upon in the future to explore additional features and functionality.

# Note

This project is a work in progress and not a complete solution. Features may not work as intended and the project may be
updated or changed at any time.
